# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Product.create(name: "Aubergine", price:2.9, unit:"kg" )
# Product.create(name: "Ail frais", price:1.0, unit:"100g" )
# Product.create(name: "Chutney", price:3, unit:"Pi√®ce" )
